//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
Breath First (search closest nodes to top first)

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
Breath First (DFS would be too long)
However BFS has some memory concers.

//If the tree is very wide:
Depth First (BFS needs too much memory)

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
Depth First

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
Depth First

//Finding the shortest path:
Breath First
